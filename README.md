# How can I create an exectuable file ?
If you use Linux:

1- You have to clone or download the repo.
2- Open a terminal and run 
    cd path/to/GameOfLife/
    make
3- That's it ! now you can run 
    ./prog.out

Else: try linux :p

# What should I do know ?
The programm is asking you: 
  the number of generation you want,
  if you want to disable the border (if you disable them every cell will have height neighbor),
  and a file to open. Some example are in the firstGeneration folder but feel free to create your own !!
  
know enjoy ! :D

# What libraries did I use ?
I use the SDL2 (Simple Direct-media Layer) with SDL image 2.0. They are used to do all the displaying.
