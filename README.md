# How can I create an exectuable file ?
##If you use Linux:

1. You have to clone or download the repo.
2. Open a terminal and run 
    * `cd path/to/GameOfLife/`
    * `make`
3. That's it ! Now you can run 
    * `./prog.out`

##Else: try linux :p

# What should I do know ?
The programm is asking you: 
    * the number of generation you want,
    * if you want to disable the border (if you disable them every cell will have eight neighbor),
    * and a file to open. Some example are in the firstGeneration folder but feel free to create your own !!
  
know enjoy ! :D

# What libraries did I use ?
I use the __SDL2__ (Simple Direct-media Layer) with __SDL image 2.0__. They are used to do all the displaying.
